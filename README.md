Challenges

Technical Challenge:

The most difficult technical challenge we encountered this week was optimizing database queries for improved performance. We had to carefully analyze the data structure and implement indexing to enhance query speed.
Non-Technical Challenge:

The most difficult non-technical challenge we faced was coordinating schedules among team members for collaborative coding sessions. We addressed this challenge by implementing a shared calendar and setting clear meeting times.
